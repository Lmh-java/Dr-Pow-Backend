**Identity at the START of the term**

At the start of the term, I had almost no study habits and winged almost every exam – however, I was very confident in my academic skills. I almost exclusively studied alone and generally had a low sense of belonging since I didn’t know anyone before coming to UBC. 

**Five factors that influenced my journey**

1. Almost failing my ASTR exams

    A learning experience that made me more conscious about how much I need to study and gave me a awakening that university would be different than high school. I decided to invest in better note taking equipment and pay more attention in lectures from that experience.


2. Learning about handwritten notes and study strategies

    I decided to invest in an iPad to take better notes and because I learned that handwritten notes are more effective for learning. I also solidified my understanding of learning techniques such as the spacing effect, the pomodoro technique, and summarizing information for a better understanding of the content. 

3. Course planning session and brainstorming

    I liked the course planning session as I learned much more about my degree requirements. Beforehand, I didn’t know much about what courses I needed to take – now, I’ve planned out my whole degree in a spreadsheet and I know what courses I’ll be looking to take in the next couple of years. I also feel more comfortable in my backups if I don’t manage to get into computer science.

4. Student UTA panel

    I found that hearing advice from upperclassmen about exam strategies and about navigating my time at university was very helpful. Since they are a couple years older, they’ve gone through exactly the kind of experience I will and their reflective retrospective helped me better understand the obstacles in my way.

5. UBC clubs and events

    At the beginning of the term there were many social events, and I was a frequent participant during the first few months. I found that participating in these events helped me gain a better sense of belonging, helped me get a better understanding of my career path (if it was a career event), and helped me gain excitement for what university had to offer in the future.


**Identity at the END of the term**

At the end of the term I started to plan out study sessions and was becoming more conscious about how much I’m studying. Although I still mostly studied alone, I also occasionally studied with others. Compared to the beginning of the term, I have a higher sense of belonging. Moving forward, I see myself developing myself as a person and as a student.
